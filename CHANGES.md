## CHANGES

- 2026-02-14: Centered and spaced mobile control buttons.
  - `src/styles.css`: Updated `.mobile-controls` to center the control cluster horizontally at the bottom, ensured vertical spacing between `up`, `left/right`, and `down` buttons, and increased horizontal gap for left/right buttons. Added responsive adjustments for small screens.
